# Sensors Analytics

This is the official Ruby SDK for Sensors Analytics.

## Easy Installation

You can get Sensors Analytics SDK using gem.
Add below to you `Gemfile`

```
  gem 'sensors_analytics_sdk'
```

Or execute `gem install` as below.

```
  gem install sensors_analytics_sdk
```

Once the SDK is successfully installed, use the Sensors Analytics SDK likes:

```ruby
  require 'sensors_analytics_sdk'

  SA_URL = 'http://sa_host.com:8006/sa?token=xxx'

  consumer = SensorsAnalytics::DefaultConsumer.new(SA_URL)
  sa = SensorsAnalytics::SensorsAnalytics.new(consumer)

  distinct_id = "ABCDEF123456"
  sa.track(distinct_id, "UserLogin", {"Source" : "HomePage"})
```

Http keepalive is supported now. Add gem `net-http-persistent` to your `Gemfile`. Then it will use http keepalive by default.
